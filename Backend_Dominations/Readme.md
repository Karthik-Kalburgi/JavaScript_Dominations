Map when you peform map on an 4 digit array when you write inside 13 what it will do is it will ccreate 4 empty spaces coz there is 4 elements and every time it will go each array elemet what ever we wrote in return statement as 13 all values will be written 13 

map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.

map() does not execute the function for empty elements.

map() does not change the original array.
