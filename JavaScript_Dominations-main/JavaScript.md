# JavaScript_Dominations

Hoisting - The variables and functions are hoisted which means the 
           Declaration is moved on top of the code  var a;
                                                    a=12;


Undefined and Not Defined - which is not existence is not defined . Undefined which is existence which we dont know ex
                            who is most intelligent people in the world.

Types in js - Primitive and Reference   - Ref [] () {} 0 undefined null 

Reference - when you assign a reference in a value  it will copy the reference not the obk itself Both var will point same obj 
            in memory.

Functions - Function is a group of code which performs specific task 
            used for 3 types whenever we can call the function , we can do recersive (Re-use code), used for diff data (params,args)

Array - Group of values You can store multiple data on a single variable

Splice  - is to remove a particular value in an array [2,2]

Prop and method - inside an obj is called prop,
                  inside an obj which holds an function is called method

var let const - var , old js   fun scoped ,var adds up with the window object
                window object is nothing but it uses the features from the browser (log,alert)
                reason it exposes varibles  in data
                let , new js  braces scoped , doesnt add  window object

Heap Memory - when we run a program of addition of 4 numbers while (computing ) calculating the numbers  it will store in a heap memory 


Truthy Falsy Values - falsy values are null NaN 0 false undefined doccument.all

ForEach Loop - is used when you have only array and want to perform something in an array  2+2

ForIn loop - used for objects to loop 

coercion  it s type which converts the operands what to perform based on the operator + (add,concat "1"+1 string concat  ) -(only one perform sub) 

TypeCasting - JS refers to the conversion of one data type to another data type is called typecasting num to string.

Interpreter - it converst byte code to machine code.
compilers  - it converts high level language into  machine  level code 

window is the collection of all the tools which are avaliable in the js.

Types of Functions

function (){
  function statement
}

let abcd = function(){
  function expression
}
funciton(){
  anonymous function
}
()=>{
  Fat arrow function
}

var g = (a)=>{
  fat arrow with one parameters
}
g(12)

Array is an linear ds which stores multiple values in a continous manner.

In Strings push does not work on strings since string is not array ,In strings push,pop der is no function coz its not array.


Strings - Group of char,collection of char, sequence of char it behaves like array coz we can peform indexing,
          Strings are immutable in nature.

Slice is used for both -ve , +ve indexes where as substring is used only for +ve.

CharcodeAt - used for alphabets ASCHII values A-65 B-66
