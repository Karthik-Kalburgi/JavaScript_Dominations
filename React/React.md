React 

Jsx power  - we can use dynamic data (numbers , multiplication  {})

Fragments - In react multiple  components are needed to return multiple elememts so we need to wrap  within a single parent .

UseState -   useState() inside brackets you can keep number,array,objects,true/false
  score and Setscore (score is an value ) and (setScore is an function  which keeps on updating the values )

  Props (passing the data via Props) - props are used how you pass data from one component to another as parameters.
                                       The primary use of props is to data transfer from parent component to child components 
                                       This data can be various such as arrays ,objects,strings,boolean and even functions

React - REact will only react when we use state(use effect,use state) if u do obj,array it wont react .

Dynamic Routing - useParams is a hook in React Router that allows you to access route parameters from the current URL. A route parameter is a part of the URL that is variable (e.g., /product/:id), and it can be used to pass data to components dynamically.
                Dynamic ROuting can be used to open same component and different component as well for same Component use (Outlet).

ajax act as a comminucation btwn backend and frontend
